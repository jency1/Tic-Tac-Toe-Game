# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a simple and interactive web-based game built using React. It allows two players to compete against each other by marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. The game also features a replay button to start a new round.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: Easy-to-use interface with responsive design.
- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns to place their respective symbols (X or O).
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects a win or draw and displays the result.
- **Dynamic Game State**: The game state is managed dynamically using React's component-based architecture, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Optimized Build with Vite**: Built using Vite for faster development and optimized production builds.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the dynamic components and manage the game state.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary programming language used for logic implementation.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the game.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game interface, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- **Node.js & npm**: For managing dependencies and running the development server.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server for modern web projects, replacing Create React App for better performance.
